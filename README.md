# reconciler

This package aims to provide helper functions for accessing APIs compatible with the [Reconciliation Service API standard](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/), which developed from the [OpenRefine Reconciliation API](https://docs.openrefine.org/technical-reference/reconciliation-api/). Currently it consists of a single user-facing function, `reconcile()`.
